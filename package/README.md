# AI Course Assistant

The AI Course Assistant Python package is designed to facilitate communication between INGInious and a serve. This assistant simplifies the process by automating the exchange of information such as questions, student responses, grades, â€¦

## Installation

To install the AI Course Assistant package, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ ai-course-assistant
```

## Usage

The package offers a straightforward API that allows instructors to send and receive information about student answers. Here is an example of how to use the package:

1. Import the `AICourseAssistant` class from the package and initialize it with the server URL and access token.

```python
from ai_course_assistant import AICourseAssistant

AICourseAssistant.init("https://example.com/get_feedback", "your_access_token")
```

2. Create an instance of the `AICourseAssistant` class with the question and the expected answer.

```python
assistant = AICourseAssistant("What is the capital of France?", "Paris")
```

3. Add optional attributes such as the maximum grade or the solution.

```python
assistant.add_grade(10)
assistant.add_solution("Paris")
assistant.add_output("the ouput of the code when executed")
```


4. Use the `ask_feedback` method to get feedback on the student's answer. This method will send all the necessary information to the server and return the feedback.

```python
print(assistant.ask_feedback())
```
